# Welcome
This is a repository containing popular ways of organizing folders in software projects. 

The intention is to minimize the amount of time spent thinking about how to organize large scale projects and spend more time coding.

This is realatively new, but please contribute your favorite folder structures (or module structures for very niche things like multi module gradle apps). 

The real question is: how do you organize a repository about organizing :)
